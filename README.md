# `OnSeAn` - One Search Answer

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/11e30bc9-5972-4bf9-adad-ec43f8df87c2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/onsean/deploys)

A better answer for your single query is important to save lot of time. We use StackOverflow and other issue handling platforms. But having multiple answers and trying all is a bad sign. Here I am trying to formulate an idea to save my own time first and save other devs time as well in the long run.

## How users can search for item?
- [ ] Platform based query
- [ ] Version based query
- [ ] OS based query
- [ ] Timespan based query


## Problems:
* #### How to get unique search entry?

    One possibility is to have [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) platform to upload the title which are unique hashes.
* #### Query large documents
    
    ...
    
## Tech Stack:
    * Git as Data
    * Netlify CMS

## How to run locally?
```
$ yarn
$ netlify dev (or gatsby develop)
```

Lets save time!
